- **Better web compatibility** across all browsers
- **Reduced bandwidth usage** for users

### Current Files to Convert:
```
music/a-thousand-years.mp4 â†’ music/a-thousand-years.mp3
music/Hon-ca-yeu.mp4 â†’ music/Hon-ca-yeu.mp3
```

- Mix both formats in the same playlist

**Note**: MP3 will always be prioritized for faster loading!
